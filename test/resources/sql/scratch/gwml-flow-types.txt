		<documentation>Describes the elements required to capture groundwater flow information.</documentation>
	<element  GW_Recharge
			<documentation>Fluid added to an aquifer by various means such as precipitation, injection, etc.</documentation>
	<element  GW_Flow
			<documentation>Process by which the water enters or exits a hydrogeologic unit or a void, or flows within a unit or a void. Can flow from/to other natural or man-made features such as rivers, filtration stations, etc.</documentation>
					<element  gwFlowPersistence
							<documentation>The regularity of flow occurrence, e.g. ephemeral, intermittent, perennial, seasonal. After http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/codeList/WaterPersistenceValue/ (INSPIRE 2013).</documentation>
					<element  gwFlowProcess
							<documentation>The process causing the flow, e.g. evapotranspiration, evaporation, transpiration, runoff, baseflow, pumping, infiltration, injection, etc.</documentation>
					<element  gwFlowTime
							<documentation>Refers to the duration, instant or interval of the flow (actual time, not observation time). E.g. "yearly", "summer", "2009" or "2009-2011".</documentation>
					<element  gwFlowVelocity
							<documentation>Measure of water volume per unit of time.</documentation>
					<element  gwFlowVolumeRate
							<documentation>Measure of water quantity per time period with uom.</documentation>
	<element  GW_InterFlow
			<documentation>Fluid flow between features through an interface, exiting one feature and entering another. Features into which fluid is flowing are usually units, voids, or fluid bodies, but can be natural surface water features such as rivers or lakes, or even man-made features such as dams or canals. Likewise for features where water is exiting.</documentation>
					<element  gwFlowDestinationBody
							<documentation>The fluid body into which water is flowing.</documentation>
					<element  gwFlowDestinationContainer
							<documentation>The feature into which water is flowing.</documentation>
					<element  gwFlowInterfaceFeature
							<documentation>The feature that denotes the interface between, for example, the groundwater and surface, such as a well, spring, seep, etc., or between two aquifers.</documentation>
					<element  gwFlowLocation
							<documentation>The location at which water is being transferred from one one feature into another.</documentation>
					<element  gwFlowSourceBody
							<documentation>The fluid body from which water is flowing.</documentation>
					<element  gwFlowSourceContainer
							<documentation>The feature from which water is flowing.</documentation>
	<element  GW_IntraFlow
			<documentation>Fluid flow within a feature such as a unit, void, groundwater body, or even a man-made feature such as a conduit of some kind.</documentation>
					<element  gwFlowBody
							<documentation>The fluid body that is flowing.</documentation>
					<element  gwFlowContainer
							<documentation>The entity in which the groundwater is flowing. Typically a unit, void, or groundwater body, but also be a man-made feature such as some conduit.</documentation>
					<element  gwFlowLocation
							<documentation>The location where groundwater is flowing within a feature.</documentation>
	<element  GW_Discharge
			<documentation>An outflow of fluid from a container such as an aquifer, watershed, pipe, etc.</documentation>
	<element  GW_WaterBudget
			<documentation>An accounting of the water input and output of a hydrogeologic unit, at a particular point in time, with a description of inflows and outflows.</documentation>
			<element  gwBudgetAmount
					<documentation>Final quantity (sum) of the budget.  If recharge = discharge, the sum is 0.</documentation>
			<element  gwBudgetDischarge
					<documentation>Discharge (outflows) considered in the budget.</documentation>
			<element  gwBudgetRecharge
					<documentation>Recharge (inflows) considered by the budget.</documentation>
			<element  gwBudgetValidTime
					<documentation>Validity time of this budget (eg, 2010).</documentation>
