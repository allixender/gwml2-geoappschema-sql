These can be delineated by human factors such as policy or regulation concerns, as well as domain (in this case hydrogeologic or hydrologic) concerns. The management area does not necessarily align exactly with the associated hydrogeologic feature boundaries.

                        <documentation>Voids represent the spaces inside (hosted by) a unit or its material. E.g. the pores in an aquifer, or in the sandstone of an aquifer. Voids are hosted by a container (e.g. an aquifer), and can contain water bodies. Voids are differentiated from 'porosity' in that porosity is the proportion of void volume to total volume (i.e. container + voids), while voids are the spaces themselves. Their delineation as a distinct entity is necessary, for example, to capture the volume of fractures in an aquifer.</documentation>
