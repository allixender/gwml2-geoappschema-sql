	<element  GW_Constituent
			<documentation>General (abstract) entity denoting a material, chemical or biological constituent of a fluid body.</documentation>
					<element  gwState
							<documentation>The physical state of the constituent, i.e. solid, liquid, or gas.</documentation>
					<element  gwConstituent
							<documentation>Relates to constituents composing another constituent</documentation>
					<element  gwConstituedOf
							<documentation>Relates to the constituent which a constituent is part of</documentation>
			<documentation>The physical state of the constituent, i.e. solid, liquid, or gas.</documentation>
			<documentation>The physical state of the constituent, i.e. solid, liquid, or gas.</documentation>
					<documentation>A gas is a compressible fluid. Not only will a gas conform to the shape of its container but it will also expand to fill the container. (wikipedia)</documentation>
					<documentation>A liquid is a nearly incompressible fluid that conforms to the shape of its container but retains a (nearly) constant volume independent of pressure. (Wikipedia)</documentation>
					<documentation>In a solid the particles (ions, atoms or molecules) are closely packed together. The forces between particles are strong so that the particles cannot move freely but can only vibrate (wikipedia)</documentation>
	<element  GW_MaterialConstituent
			<documentation>Suspended or colloidal material in a fluid body, e.g sediment.</documentation>
					<element  gwMaterial
							<documentation>Name of the suspended or colloid material in the fluid body, e.g. a lithology or mineral name.</documentation>
	<element  GW_ConstituentRelation
			<documentation>Relation between fluid body components, typically caused by a specific mechanism, e.g. coating (from adsorption), constitution (from chemical bonding forming a new material), aggregation (from physical bonding, e.g. pressure), containment (from absorption, digestion).</documentation>
					<element  gwConstituentRelationType
							<documentation>Type of relation between fluid body components, typically caused by a specific mechanism, e.g. coating (from adsorption), constitution (from chemical bonding forming a new material), aggregation (from physical bonding, e.g. pressure), containment (from absorption, digestion).</documentation>
					<element  gwConstituentRelationMechanism
							<documentation>Mechanisms by which materials (of various states) come into a relationship, e.g. sorption, precipitation, digestion, excretion, etc.</documentation>
					<element  gwConstitutedOf
							<documentation>Relates to the constituent which a constituent is part of</documentation>
					<element  gwConstituent
							<documentation>Relates to constituents composing another constituent</documentation>
			<element  mineralName
					<documentation>Name of the mineral (eg: orthoclase) or mineral family (eg: feldspar), approved by the International Mineralogical Association. (eg: http://www.mindat.org/mineralindex.php)</documentation>
			<element  lithology
					<documentation>A controlled concept indicating the name of the RockMaterial type (eg, quartz sandstone, basalt, muscovite schist, sand, mud, soil, saprolite). Igneous rock definitions are governed by IUGS agreed vocabulary</documentation>
